![The Umbrella Cluster](../assets/images/hpc-umbrella-full.png){ align=right width=350 }

The TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster is the HPC cluster of the TU/e consisting of departmental supplied compute (CPU and GPU)
resources and managed by the HPC Lab. It's one of the High Performance Computing solutions the HPC Lab offers.

As the TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster is managed centrally, you can get access with your TU/e account. Depending on your
department/research group, you can get access to certain part of TU/e Umbrella HPC Cluster.
