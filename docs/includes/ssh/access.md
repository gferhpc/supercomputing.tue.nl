    1. **Launch MobaXterm**:
    
        Open MobaXterm by double-clicking its icon on your desktop or finding it in your Start menu.
    
    2. **Start a New SSH Session**:
    
        To initiate a new SSH session, click on the `Session` icon in the top left corner of the MobaXterm window. In the session settings window, select `SSH`.
    
    3. **Configure Your SSH Settings**:
    
        In the SSH session configuration, fill in the following details:
    
        - **Remote host**: Enter `hpc.tue.nl`.
        - **Specify username**: Enter your SSH username, e.g., `s133320`.
        - **Port**: Leave this set to `22`, the default SSH port.
    
        If you have a private key for authentication, check the box for `Use private key` and browse to the key file location, typically `C:\Users\yourusername\.ssh\id_rsa`.
    
    4. **Save and Start the Session**:
    
        Click `OK` to save the session settings and connect to the server. MobaXterm will attempt to establish a connection.
    
    5. **Verify the Connection**:
    
        On your first connection, you'll be prompted to verify the server's authenticity. You'll see a message like this:
    
        ```
        The server's host key is unknown. Do you trust this host key?
        ```
    
        Choose `Yes` to add the server's fingerprint to the known hosts, allowing future connections without prompts.
    
    6. **Access the Server**:
    
        After a successful connection, you will have access to the server's command line interface in the terminal tab that opens, where you can execute commands.
    
    7. **Close the SSH Session**:
    
        To disconnect from the server, simply close the terminal tab or exit MobaXterm. This action will end the SSH session.

        On your first connection, you'll be prompted to verify the server's authenticity. You'll see a message like this:
    
        ```
        The authenticity of host 'hpc.tue.nl (xx.xx.xx.xx)' can't be established.
        ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:abcdefg...
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
        ```
    
        Type `yes` and press Enter. This action will add the server's fingerprint to your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file, allowing future connections without prompts.
    
    4. **Access the Server**:
