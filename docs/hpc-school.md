# HPC School events

No upcoming editions of the HPC School planned.

The HPC School events at the TU/e Supercomputing Center are specialized training sessions focused on high-performance
computing (HPC). Held twice a year, typically in Autumn and Spring, these events cater to a wide audience, including
students, researchers, and professionals from academia and industry. Each session provides in-depth training on
supercomputing, ranging from introductory topics for beginners to advanced techniques for experienced users.

Participants engage in hands-on workshops, lectures from expert keynote speakers, and interactive sessions, covering
topics like deep learning, simulation, and energy-efficient computing. The HPC School serves as a key platform for
enhancing computational skills and fostering collaboration within the HPC community.

Stay tuned for announcements on future editions through the official channels.
